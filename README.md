# Mathematica Code to Create Art for the Wolfram Generative Art Contest in 2022.
## Third place winner in 2022
The Kuramoto Model (KM) is a popular non-linear model to describe synchronization. In this work, I ultilized Mathematica's ODE solver to generate plots of the KM with phase-lags under changing coordinate plane. For a static version of the notebook, the blog post about my work can be found here https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2509110.
